ABSTRACT
==================
This project demonstrates the automated creation of PHP client proxy classes for WCF. The example contains both service contract and data contract classes for php.

FEATURES
==================
- Base class to provide generic features (like SOAP_Client instantiation or error-handling)
- Low-level SOAP_Client calls for maximum control about the data interactionsWcfT4Client.Service
- DataContracts are generated with doc-comments to provide C# type information
- PHP classes are generated using default ServiceModel attributes

DETAILS
==================
In order to provide the necessary interoperability for interacting with php clients from WCF, there are some caveats:

- You are restricted to basicHttpBinding's
- The generated WSDL has to be flattened, this is done using the WCFExtras project (see app.config)
- Make sure you provide namespaces for the following elements:
	- Each ServiceBehavior attribute has to have a namespace (set on service implementation)
	- Each endpoint configuration entry has to have the matching ServiceBehavior namespace on "bindingNamespace" attribute

Since there is no way to test these php templates in a solution-integrated way, there are no tests provided.
The WCF implementations are just examples to demonstrate the T4 templates, they should be adopted to your own WCF project.

USAGE
==================
To use these templates in your own projects, follow these steps:

1) Copy all T4 templates from the WcfT4Client.PhpGenerator project to your own project.
2) Add references to System.ServiceModel, your service contract and data contract projects in the project containing the T4 templates.
3) Modify the solution base path in GlobalSettings.ttinclude.
4) Modify the options dictionary in both contract T4 templates to match your setup.
5) Modify your service project according the example to implement WSDL flattening
	5.1) Add a reference to the WCFExtras assembly
	5.2) Change your configuration file according to the comments in WcfT4Client.Service/App.config
6) Enjoy.
